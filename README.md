1) What's PigML?

   PigML is a machine learning pack leveraging Apache Pig.
   
   Machine learning algorithms in PigML will typically consists
   a) Pig UDFs - the atomic and core part algorithm
   b) PigLatin scripts - connect and make data flow between UDFs, including
      data loading, storing, filtering, joining, grouping etc
   c) shell scripts - connect and make data flow between PigLatin scripts.
   
2) Why PigML?

   When talking about big data and machine learning, there exists alternatives 
   like Apache Mahout. Yet we believe Pig is a great utility doing this job in 
   both development efficiency and runtime flexibility.
   
3) How to use it?

   Description of algorithms and easy to go sample Pig scripts (PigLatin) will 
   come along with the codes.
